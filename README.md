# clipboard-cleaner-macos

Mac menu app for cleaning your clipboard to prevent not-so-nice apps from stealing sensitive data.

This is the MacOS implementation of the iOS app of the same name https://github.com/jgcaruso/clipboard-cleaner

Note: Built in AppKit to support older OSes and so I could follow the steps in this fantastic article https://medium.com/@acwrightdesign/creating-a-macos-menu-bar-application-using-swiftui-54572a5d5f87
